# 2D Game Engine

This is a small 2D game engine I am working on as part of the [2D Game Engine with C++ and Lua](https://pikuma.com/courses/cpp-2d-game-engine-development) series at [Pikuma.com](https://pikuma.com/)[^1]. All visual assets are provided by [Pikuma.com](https://pikuma.com/), as well as reference code which serves as the basis of my own code.

This is very much a work-in-progress at the moment. I will update as I progress through the course.

## Building

Before compiling the code, you will need to add the GLM, ImGui, Lua, and Sol libraries in the `libs` directory.

To compile the code, simply execute the makefile using `make` in the root directory (assuming you have g++ installed on your system).

## Running

Execute `make run` in the root folder.

## Footnotes
